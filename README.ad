libjsonp
========

== Todo

.Finish documenting headers
[NOTE]
libjsonp.h, libjsonpp.h missing, (spellcheck ...)

.Need Tests
[NOTE]
Need to write tests. Currently dummy bin.

.Check binary
[NOTE]
Need to check the binary (get segfaults on / and empty obj, probably simple dump check). Also comment and enhance (use getopt? no mit, no std ...)

.Need README after done
[NOTE]
Replace me when done :)

.Better build system
[WARNING]
Need a better makefile, build system (help welcome)
