Create JSON-RPC like test file and tester like so:

{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0", /* does not matter */
	"method": "merge", /* test name */
	"params": [{}, {}], /* test args */
	"id": null, /* does not matter, test id? */
	"result": {}, /* test cmp */
	"error": {"code": -1, "message": "Could not merge"} /* test fail, to print */
}

Current tests are only very simple and not at all complete. Though the lib should work as intended (no guarantees of course).
